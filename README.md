# For Statistics Tran

This project has been created to learn a little bit of Fortran and Perl programming languages, the project is about a statistics solver, you must have a file which represent a table, for example:
```
1 2 3 45
23 4 5 1
23 3 1 3
   ...
3 4 6 10
```

The delimiter must be a white space, and you can run it with:
```console
$ perl run.pl filename
```

I'm gonna write every formula used in this project and explain it, just give a few seconds...!
